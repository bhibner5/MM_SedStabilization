MM Sed Stabilization repository 

This repository includes R code and the data accompanying the manuscript "The overlooked role of microbial mats in coastal resilience: Stabilization of sediment through trapping and binding". 

The rmd file titled "plots of all trapping and binding exps" includes data processing and plotting for all sediment stabilzation experiments (24-hr field incubation experiments, Multi-day in situ field incubation experiments), and background ooid coverage on mats. The rmd file titled "filament_TB_exp" includes plotting for filament movement over delivered sediment and uses the "Filament_tb_exp.xlsx" file that is not found in the data file. Tide_plotF is the plotting file for tide submergence at each site and tilt_meter_0622 correspondences to the supplimentary figure flow speed in a channel.
